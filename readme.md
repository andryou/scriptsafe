# ScriptSafe
A Chrome extension with over 107,000 users that brings some of NoScript's functionality to Chrome while emphasizing simplicity and intuitiveness (no affiliation to NoScript).

Note: due to the nature of this extension, this will break most sites! It is designed to learn over time with sites that you allow.

## Features

* block unwanted content (MVPS HOSTS, hpHOSTS (ad / tracking servers only), Peter Lowe's HOSTS Project, MalwareDomainList.com, and DNS-BH – Malware Domain Blocklist are integrated!)
* block click-through referrer data
* spoof referrer/user-agent data
* block unwanted cookies
* "intuitive" icon that changes based on whether or not a page is whitelisted/blacklisted/bypassed
